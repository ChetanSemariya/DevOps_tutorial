1969 - Mai Project Withdraw krliya gaya and 3 logo ne chod diyaa, lekin 2 persons Dennie Ritche and ken Thomson ne ise dobara se banane ka socha

1975 mai UNIX V6 (version 6 aaya jo bada popular hua jiske baad logo ne apne khud se commercial OS banana start krdiya jise flavour or UNIX kaha jaata hai)
    
**** Flavour of UNIX :-

1). IBM-AIX (IBM company ka aix)
2). SUN-Sobris (sun company ka sobris)
3). Mac-OS (apple ka Mac)
4). HP- UX (HP ka ux OS)

REVOLUTIONARY CHANGE :-

IN 1991 - Linus Torvalds comes and require an operating system for his personal work but at that time nothing is free and everyone sells their OS for higher amount so he think he created a new OS which is free and open source so he created LINUX
=> Linux ko banane ke liye linus ne unke Professor Andrew Tanenbawn ke dwara banaye gye MINIX OS ko phle acha se smjha then uska base banake Linux ko banaya

Note :- Linux is a kernel not Operating system.

Linux + GNU (Bunch of softwares) == Operating System

Defination :- Operating system is the combination of Linux and GNU where linux is the kernal and gnu is a bunch of softwares.


************ Distribution of Linux jo linux se hi nikle hai and market mai bahut popular hai **************

1). RHEL (Red Hat enterprise Linux) is a company which provide this OS
2). Fedora OS (Run by group of people)
3). Debian OS
4). Others (Ubuntu, CentOS, Amazon Linux)
5). Kali Linux (used mostly in hacking)

=> centOs - Fastest Operating system (centOs full form is COMMUNITY ENTERPRISE OPERATING SYSTEM)
=> ubuntu - world 3rd most use popular OS here ubuntu means TeamWork

## Operating System is working on two types :-

1). CLI (Command line Interface) => Isme sare operations command ke through hote hai 
2). GUI (Graphical User Interface) => Easy to use like windows everything we can see and learn

NOTE:- Linux mai bhi GUI hota hai but sabme nahi hota only kuch mai hi hota hai. Mainly Linux is popular for its CLI Interface

// ------------------ SOME BASIC DEFINATIONS ------------------------- //

=> Linux is kernel not OS
=> Linux is not a Unix derivative.It was written from scratch
=> A linux distribution is the linux kernal and a collection of software (GNU) that together, create an OS


// ------------------ LINUX FEATURES ---------------------------- //

Note:- Android is based in linux kernel.

1). Open Source (windows free nahi hai license lena pdta hai)
2). Secure (windows mai agar koi virus aaya hai to voo poore system mai fel jaata hai, but linux mai phle baar to virus aasani se aata nahi hai and agar aabhi gaya to vo jiss folder mai hai usi mai rahega and hum use easily delete bhi krskte hai but windows mai hum aisa nahi krskte hai virus ko nikalne ke liye hume antivirus lagane padte hai to uski cost and agar usse bhi nahi hua to frr last options window-reinstall jisse humare data ka loss hojaata hai)
3). Simplified updates for all Installed software
4). Light weight (RAM consumption very low and size is also very low)
5). MultiUser & Multitask as well (N number of users connect krskte hai i.e ek server pr hazaro log work krskte hai but windows mai limitations hai users ki)
6). Multiple distribution (Operating System) - Redhat, Debian and Fedora, Kali Linux

Linux 1GB RAM = 50GB OF windows
