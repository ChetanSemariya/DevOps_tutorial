Why we use cloud services and why it is so popular ?

Q). What is server ?
A => Server vo device hai jisse hume service milti hai as the name suggests. 
=> Server ka benifit yhh hai ki uspe ek sath 1000 logo ko ek hi baar mai same chij dikhai jaa skti hai that mean ek sath sabhi logo ko service provide karana

Note:- Phle agar hume kuch bhi business setup krna padta tha to uske liye hume server purchase krna padte the and unn sabhi servers ki keemat bahut mehngi hua krti hai jisse capital expenditure bahut badh jaata tha including networking, router setup as well (i.e jo phle se paisa lagaya jaata hai). iska mtlb business start hone se phle hi lakho rupay usme lag jaate the and server setup krne mai bhi time lagta tha.

Problems :-

1). Capital Expenditure bahut jyada lagta tha starting mai hi and iski bhi koi guarantee nahi thi ki website chalegi hi chalegi
2). Time consuming also (for server setup)

SOLUTIONS :- AWS which is Public Cloud Provider (Market Leaders sabse phle aaya)
2). Azure
3). Google Cloud Provider
4). Alibaba

=> Benifit :- sari chije khud se hi krke de deta hai rent pr with mimimal capital expenditure and minimal time in minutes.

**** Cloud ek aisa platform hai jo hume humara infrastructure provide karata hai and it has three types

 AWS PROVIDES :- 3 kinds of service

 Iaas => Infrastructure as a service
 paas => Platform as a service
 Saas => Software as a service

// ---------------- AWS HAS 24 REGION AND 76 Availability Zone (AZ) -------------------- //

Region :- Poore world mai jaha bhi data centre mai aws ke use region kahte hai. Jitne jyada region utna jyada speed
Availability Zone :- Jiss region ke andar availability hai cloud ki, har region ke andar atleat 2 availability zone hote hi hote hai

# Cloud :- Whatever you are accessing from the internet is cloud. Cloud is not storage or cloud is also not a server. Cloud is a service which gives you resources (server, storage) which you can use from remote location and you can pay according to your usage.
Ex:- Google Drive
